# IC2S2 Thinking with Deep Learning Tutorial


Hi! Welcome to the Thinking with Deep Learning tutorial at IC2S2 2024.

By the end of this tutorial and lecture you should be able to explore an entire world of deep learning powered social science research.

Some practical notes:

1) Open this google colab notebook - https://colab.research.google.com/drive/15-bzNOzVZNoP_sLVDmZ051UcVFFmzP12?usp=sharing, and then make a copy. Rename your new file, and start working in this. If you have a very powerful machine then you can also run locally, but might need to adjust your code a bit for that (with data and so on). 

2) It is unlikely you will be able to run all the code in the notebook as we go through the tutorial. Don't bother keeping up with it all! Rather, remember what's in the code, and see how it can be used later - that being said, all the code does work!
  
3) There are parts of the code that require you to download a model - you can run through the notebook in advance and download these, as well as the package installations.

4) The data folder has some data that is required during the tutorial - it would be a good idea to just download this repository to make it easier for you down the line.
